# Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) Pipeline Setup with Jenkins

## Introduction
In this session, we are going to create both Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) pipelines using Jenkins for a Java application. The goal is to automate the process of packaging, testing, and deploying an application. We'll cover the entire setup process, from creating a CI job to deploying the application on an Apache Tomcat server. Here's the flow:

1. **CI Pipeline**: The developer pushes code to GitHub, Jenkins pulls it, builds it, and creates an artifact (a `.war` file).
2. **CD Pipeline**: The artifact created in the CI pipeline is deployed to an Apache Tomcat server on a remote Linux machine.

## Job 1: Continuous Integration Job (CI)

### Goal:
The goal of this job is to package the Java application into a `.war` file, which is the artifact needed for deployment.

### Steps:
1. **Create a New Jenkins Job**:
   - Log in to Jenkins and click on **New Item**.
   - Choose **Freestyle Project** and name it "Package Application".

2. **Configure GitHub Repository**:
   - In the **Source Code Management** section, choose **Git**.
   - Enter the URL of the GitHub repository where the source code is hosted.
   - Configure any necessary credentials to access the repository.

3. **Add Build Step for Maven**:
   - In the **Build** section, add a **Build Step** and select **Invoke Maven**.
   - Use the following Maven goals to build the project:
     ```bash
     clean package
     ```
   - This will ensure that the project is freshly built each time.

4. **Archive the `.war` File**:
   - In the **Post-build Actions** section, select **Archive the artifacts**.
   - Add the file pattern for the `.war` file (e.g., `target/*.war`).

5. **Run the Job**:
   - Once everything is set up, click **Build Now**.
   - Ensure the `.war` file is successfully built and archived.

6. **Configure the Job to Run on a Jenkins Slave**:
   - In the **Build** section, specify the **Label** to ensure this job runs on the slave machine (e.g., `my-slave`).

## Job 2: Continuous Delivery Job (CD)

### Goal:
The goal of this job is to deploy the `.war` file created in Job 1 to an Apache Tomcat server.

### Steps:

1. **Create a New Jenkins Job for Deployment**:
   - Create a new job and name it "Deploy Application".
   - This job will not need the source code from GitHub since it will only deploy the `.war` file created in Job 1.

2. **Install the Required Jenkins Plugins**:
   - **Copy Artifact Plugin**: This plugin allows us to copy the artifact (i.e., `.war` file) from Job 1.
   - **Deploy to Container Plugin**: This plugin allows us to deploy the `.war` file to a Tomcat server.

   Install these plugins from the **Manage Jenkins > Manage Plugins** section.

3. **Configure Artifact Copying**:
   - In the **Build** section of the "Deploy Application" job, add a **Build Step** and select **Copy Artifact**.
   - Choose **Package Application** as the source job.
   - Configure it to copy the last successful build of the `.war` file.

4. **Configure Post-build Action to Deploy to Tomcat**:
   - Add a **Post-build Action** and select **Deploy WAR to Container**.
   - Specify the path to the `.war` file (e.g., `verify/*.war`).
   - Select **Tomcat 9** as the container.
   - Add Tomcat server credentials (e.g., username: `admin`, password: `admin`).

5. **Configure Tomcat Server Details**:
   - Enter the **IP address** of the Tomcat server.
   - Ensure that the server is accessible from the Jenkins machine (e.g., through SSH).

6. **Save the Job**:
   - Once everything is configured, save the job.

## Automating the CI/CD Process

### GitHub Webhook Integration:
- To trigger the CI job whenever changes are made to the GitHub repository, you can set up a **GitHub Webhook**.
  - In your GitHub repository settings, go to **Webhooks** and add a new webhook.
  - Use the Jenkins server’s IP address and the appropriate endpoint to trigger the job.
  - This will automatically trigger Job 1 when there are changes in the repository.

### Triggering the CD Job:
- Configure Job 2 (Deploy Application) to trigger after Job 1 completes successfully:
  - Go to **Job 2** and configure the **Build Triggers** section.
  - Choose **Build after other projects are built** and select "Package Application".
  - This ensures that once the CI job finishes, the CD job will automatically run.

---

## Test the Full CI/CD Pipeline

1. **Make Changes to the Code**:
   - Make a small change in the code (e.g., update the README file) and push it to GitHub.

2. **Verify the CI Job**:
   - Job 1 should automatically run after the GitHub webhook triggers it.
   - Check if the `.war` file is created and archived.

3. **Verify the CD Job**:
   - Once Job 1 completes, Job 2 should trigger automatically.
   - Verify that the application is deployed on Tomcat by checking the Tomcat page.

4. **Test the Deployment**:
   - Access the Tomcat server and ensure the login form (or other application page) is displayed.
   - Refresh the page to confirm that the application was updated successfully.

## Final Steps and Deployment Considerations

### Connecting to a Remote Server:
- If Jenkins and Tomcat are on separate machines, ensure that Jenkins can connect to the Tomcat server via **SSH**.
  - Set up **passwordless SSH** between Jenkins and the remote Tomcat server.
  - Verify network connectivity to ensure Jenkins can copy the artifact and deploy it.

### Key Plugins Recap:
- **Copy Artifact Plugin**: Copies artifacts from one job to another.
- **Deploy to Container Plugin**: Deploys the `.war` file to Tomcat.

---

## Deployment in a Production Environment

### Networking Considerations:
- If Jenkins and Tomcat are in the same **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)**, no extra configuration is needed for connectivity.
- If they are in **different VPCs**, set up **VPC peering** or use a **Transit Gateway** to connect them.

### High Availability in Production:
- In production, avoid running both Jenkins and the application on the same server, as this creates a **single point of failure**.
- Use multiple Jenkins slaves to distribute the load and ensure high availability.

## Conclusion

This setup covers a full CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins, GitHub, and Tomcat. By following these steps, we have:
- Automated the building and packaging of the application using Maven in Jenkins (CI).
- Set up a deployment pipeline that automatically deploys the application to a Tomcat server (CD).
- Configured everything to work seamlessly with GitHub and Jenkins webhooks.

Next, we will continue by covering topics such as Git Stash, Docker, Kubernetes, and network connectivity in more detail. Let’s take a quick break, and feel free to ask any questions about the setup process.

### Next Steps:
- Practice the pipeline setup a couple of times to become familiar with the process.
- Explore additional Jenkins configurations, such as **Build Pipelines** and **Environment Variables** for more advanced automation.
