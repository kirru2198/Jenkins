Here's a **detailed step-by-step solution** for setting up a CI pipeline that gets triggered when thereâ€™s a **push on the `develop` branch**, and **pulls the Git repository content into a folder**.

---

## âœ… Tools Assumed

We'll use **GitHub** for source control and **GitHub Actions** as the CI pipeline platform. If you're using **GitLab CI/CD**, let me know â€” the steps will be similar but the syntax differs.

## ðŸ§¾ **Objective Breakdown**

| Task | Goal                                                                |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1.   | Auto-trigger a pipeline on `develop` branch push                    |
| 2.   | Clone repository contents into a working folder during the pipeline |

---

## âœ… Step 1: Set Up Your GitHub Repository

Make sure you have a repository with a `develop` branch.

If not, create it:

```bash
git checkout -b develop
git push origin develop
```

---

## âœ… Step 2: Create GitHub Actions Pipeline

Inside your repo, create the following directory and file:

```
.github/workflows/deploy-on-develop.yml
```

### ðŸ”¹ `deploy-on-develop.yml`

```yaml
name: Deploy on Develop Push

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - develop

jobs:
  pull-code:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      # Step 1: Checkout the code from develop branch
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # Step 2: Pull code to a folder (e.g., my-code-folder)
      - name: Copy code to custom folder
        run: |
          mkdir -p my-code-folder
          cp -r ./* my-code-folder/
          
      # Step 3 (Optional): Show contents
      - name: List files in my-code-folder
        run: ls -la my-code-folder
```

---

## âœ… Step 3: Commit the Workflow

```bash
git add .github/workflows/deploy-on-develop.yml
git commit -m "Add GitHub Actions workflow for develop branch"
git push origin develop
```

---

## âœ… Step 4: Test the Pipeline

Make any change on the `develop` branch and push:

```bash
echo "Test pipeline" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Trigger CI on develop"
git push origin develop
```

Then go to **GitHub â†’ Actions tab**, and youâ€™ll see the workflow running.

---

## âœ… Outcome

* âœ… The pipeline will trigger only on `develop` branch.
* âœ… The code will be pulled and copied into `my-code-folder` within the workflow environment.

### âœ… Summary

| Step              | Command/Action                            |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Create workflow   | `.github/workflows/deploy-on-develop.yml` |
| Trigger condition | `push` to `develop`                       |
| Pull code         | `actions/checkout@v3`                     |
| Copy to folder    | `cp -r ./* my-code-folder/`               |
