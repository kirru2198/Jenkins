## Introduction to Jenkins

**Jenkins** is an open-source automation server that facilitates Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) in software development. It automates the process of building, testing, and deploying applications, allowing developers to focus on writing code.

### Why Use Jenkins?
- **Automation**: Automates repetitive tasks, reducing manual errors.
- **Integration**: Integrates with various version control systems (e.g., GitHub).
- **Extensibility**: Supports numerous plugins for added functionality.
- **Community Support**: Large community and extensive documentation.

## Setting Up Jenkins

### Prerequisites
Before installing Jenkins, ensure you have the following software installed on your server:
- **Java** (Java 17 is recommended)
- **Git** (for version control)

### Steps to Set Up Jenkins Master

1. **Install Java**:
   - Open a terminal on your Jenkins master machine and run:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk -y
     ```
   - Verify the installation:
     ```bash
     java -version
     ```

2. **Install Jenkins**:
   - Create a script to install Jenkins:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install wget -y
     wget -q -O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/keys/jenkins.io.key | sudo apt-key add -
     echo deb http://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install jenkins -y
     ```

3. **Start Jenkins**:
   - Check if Jenkins is running:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl status jenkins
     ```
   - If itâ€™s not running, start Jenkins:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl start jenkins
     ```

4. **Access Jenkins Dashboard**:
   - Open a web browser and navigate to:
     ```
     http://<your-public-ip>:8080
     ```

5. **Unlock Jenkins**:
   - Retrieve the initial admin password:
     ```bash
     sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
     ```
   - Copy the password and paste it into the Jenkins setup page.

6. **Install Suggested Plugins**:
   - Choose **"Install suggested plugins"** during the setup process.

7. **Create Admin User**:
   - Create a user (e.g., `admin`) with a password for accessing Jenkins.

8. **Finish Setup**:
   - After completing the setup, you will be directed to the Jenkins dashboard.

## Creating Jenkins Jobs

### Job 1: Package Application (CI Job)

This job will pull the code from GitHub, build it using Maven, and package it into a `.war` file.

1. **Create a New Jenkins Job**:
   - Go to the Jenkins Dashboard and click on **New Item**.
   - Name it **"Package Application"** and select **Freestyle Project**.

2. **Configure GitHub Repository**:
   - In the **Source Code Management** section, select **Git**.
   - Enter the repository URL (e.g., `https://github.com/username/repo.git`).
   - If the repository is private, add credentials by clicking on **Add** next to the Credentials dropdown.

3. **Add Build Step for Maven**:
   - In the **Build** section, click on **Add build step** and select **Invoke top-level Maven targets**.
   - Enter the following Maven goals:
     ```bash
     clean package
     ```
   - This command cleans the previous builds and packages the application.

4. **Post-build Actions**:
   - Under **Post-build Actions**, select **Archive the artifacts**.
   - Specify the file pattern for the `.war` file (e.g., `target/*.war`).

5. **Run the Job**:
   - Click **Build Now** to run the job.
   - Check the console output to ensure the build was successful and the `.war` file was created and archived.

6. **Configure the Job to Run on a Jenkins Slave**:
   - In the job configuration, under the **General** section, check the box for **Restrict where this project can be run**.
   - Enter the label of the slave node (e.g., `my-slave`) to ensure this job runs on the designated slave machine.

---

### Job 2: Deploy Application (CD Job)

This job will deploy the `.war` file generated by Job 1 to an Apache Tomcat server.

1. **Create a New Jenkins Job**:
   - Go to the Jenkins Dashboard and click on **New Item**.
   - Name it **"Deploy Application"** and select **Freestyle Project**.

2. **Copy Artifact Plugin**:
   - Ensure the **Copy Artifact Plugin** is installed. If not, go to **Manage Jenkins > Manage Plugins** and install it.
   - In the **Build** section, add a **Copy artifacts from another project** build step.
   - Select **Package Application** as the source job and specify the artifact path (e.g., `target/*.war`).

3. **Install the Deploy to Container Plugin**:
   - Go to **Manage Jenkins > Manage Plugins** and install the **Deploy to Container Plugin**.
   - After installation, go back to the job configuration.

4. **Configure Deployment to Tomcat**:
   - In the **Post-build Actions** section, select **Deploy WAR to Container**.
   - Specify the path to the `.war` file (e.g., `target/*.war`).
   - Choose **Tomcat 9** as the target container.
   - Enter the Tomcat server credentials (username and password).

5. **Configure Tomcat Server Details**:
   - Enter the **IP address** of the Tomcat server.
   - Ensure that the server is accessible from the Jenkins machine (e.g., through SSH).

6. **Save the Job**:
   - Once everything is configured, click **Save**.

## Setting Up Slave Nodes

### Creating and Configuring Slave Nodes

To set up a slave node, Jenkins must be able to connect to it via SSH. Follow these steps:

1. **Configure Security Settings**:
   - In **Manage Jenkins**, enable "TCP port for inbound agent" to random. This allows Jenkins to connect to slave nodes.

2. **Install SSH Agent Plugin**:
   - Go to **Manage Jenkins > Manage Plugins > Available**, search for **"SSH Agent"**, and install it.

3. **Add a New Node**:
   - In **Manage Jenkins > Nodes > New Node**.
   - Name it (e.g., `Node1`), select **Permanent Agent**.
   - Set the **Launch method** to **Launch agents via SSH**.
   - Enter the **Remote root directory** (e.g., `/home/username/jenkins`).
   - Add the **SSH credentials** (username and private key).

4. **Verify Node**:
   - The node should show as **online**. If there are issues, ensure the SSH connection is working correctly.

## Creating CI/CD Pipeline

### Jenkins Pipeline for Deployment

To automate the deployment process, you can create a Jenkins pipeline.

1. **Install Pipeline Plugin**:
   - Install the **Pipeline** plugin via **Manage Jenkins > Manage Plugins**.

2. **Create Pipeline View**:
   - Go to **New View** > Choose **Pipeline** and name it "CI/CD Pipeline".

3. **Add Jobs to Pipeline**:
   - Add the **"Package Application"** job for the CI process.
   - Add the **"Deploy Application"** job for the CD process.

4. **Configure Pipeline Triggers**:
   - Set the pipeline to trigger automatically after a push to GitHub or any change in the repository.

---

## Final Configuration and Troubleshooting

1. **Test the Entire Pipeline**:
   - Commit changes to the GitHub repository, and confirm if Jenkins triggers the **Package Application** job, followed by **Deploy Application**.

2. **Check Job Status**:
   - Ensure both jobs are running correctly and the artifact is deployed to Tomcat. If there are errors, review logs for troubleshooting.

## Conclusion

With Jenkins set up for both CI and CD, you're able to automate your entire workflow, from pulling code from GitHub, building it with Maven, to deploying it on a Tomcat server. The integration of Jenkins with GitHub, slave nodes, and the deployment pipeline streamlines the development process, ensuring rapid and reliable application delivery.
